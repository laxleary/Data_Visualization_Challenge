# Data Visualization Challenge
Module 5 Challenge

The following code was developed solely by me, without assistance from other students, TAs, instructors, or tutors. I confirmed some of the result numbers with Sam Lind to make sure that our data was on track. Most code was developed using tools seen in class, but I did use Google to investigate how to color and marker format in a box-and-whisker plot. While doing so may have been unecessary for the assignment, I felt that it was a worthwhile skill to practice, so I have included some such formatting in my code. The functions for these changes were found directly in Matplotlib's own documentation.
